# University-Guidelines-on-Integrating-Generative-AI

The purpose of this project was to investigate a specific research question proposed by Dr. Bei Yu: using text mining techniques, what can we determine about the state of generative AI in American universities from guidelines released on the websites of the top 100 American universities?

Project Summary
•	Extracted data from Wikidata API using OpenRefine to generate a comprehensive list of top 100 ranked universities from US News & World Report, incorporating contextual details like Carnegie ranking, size, location, and web URLs.
•	Developed custom preprocessing pipelines (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal) and applied advanced topic modeling (LDA, Bertopic) to extract six key themes from university guidelines data.
•	Conducted sentiment analysis on AI guidelines of these universities using Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned model, to determine overall positive or negative sentiment towards integrating generative AI into coursework
